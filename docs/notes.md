# notes

This project will be implemented in C++, chosen primarily for its high execution speed, efficient
memory management, and suitability for performance-critical applications. C++ also provides
fine-grained control over system resources, which aligns well with the projectâ€™s expected
complexity and optimization needs.

To ensure organized project management, all tasks, issues, milestones, ideas, and planned
improvements must be documented in the tasks.md file located within the docs/ directory. This will
serve as a central reference for tracking development progress, prioritizing work, and maintaining
clarity throughout the lifecycle of the project. 

The generated images for the motion of animated GIF should be located inside docs/ directory.

If very long pile of code is copy pasted from ChatGPT, the one to be blamed will be punished. If
you do not know how to code that is a skill issue. A programmer does not know a language by heart.
A programmer knows where to find the solution.
